# Caeser-s-Cipher
The required project's goal was to make an android app based on Caesar Cipher algorithm, that inputs a data, encrypts it based on the said algorithm, and gives an option to decrypt the data back into its Original form. To achieve this, I made an Android app, that inputs a data string in first Edit View, and on clicking the "ENCRYPT" button, it encrypts the data string and shows the encrypted data in a TextView on the same activity. To Decrypt the now encrypted data string, swipe left on the MainActivity (this) to go to the next Activity named "DecryptActivity". In this activity, the Encrypted data (original data encrypted in previous activity) is shown in the first EditView, and on clicking the "DECRYPT" button, it decrypts the data string back into its original form and displays it in the TextView in the same Activity. Further enhancements is to be made in this app very soon, to apply different encryption algorithms, such as Vigenere Cipher.
